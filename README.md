# streamline_OSINT

Despite the large volume of data available to open source intelligence (OSINT) researchers, information discovery remains an issue in human rights investigations. Human rights practitioners often face the dual responsibility of quickly uncovering the facts in response to a human rights event while simultaneously demanding policy intervention and recourse by those in power. Accuracy in these high-stakes investigations is crucial for the credibility of the whistleblowers and the safety of those involved. With the recent evolution of image classification and object-detection technology, there has emerged the potential to use computer vision and machine learning tools like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Imagen to automate aspects of the OSINT workflow in order to narrow the field of view, improve accessibility, and advance the human rights sector.

• *Classification/Obj Detection Models:* ResNet-50, Mask R-CNN, YOLOv5, YOLOv8

• *Generative AI System:* Stable-Diffusion
